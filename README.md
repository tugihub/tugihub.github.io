# TUGI Needs You

TUGI wants to be the open place for all stakeholders in user groups to collaborate but can't without you.

- You can contribute to TUGI now by editing a file within GitHub.
- TUGI has to remain simple for many skill levels to contribute.
- TUGI has no database. GitHub is where TUGI lives and consumes external API's or it's own repository.
- TUGI is markdown files now but open to other simple solutions i.e. JSON files to populate HTML.
- TUGI will appoint others to administer it as time goes on.
- TUGI is best friends with [YAGNI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/You_aren%27t_gonna_need_it) and [KISS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/KISS_principle) and walks a fine line with [DRY](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_repeat_yourself).
- TUGI is what you make it.

So go ahead, create TUGI! 

If you are worried about anything, create a non-identifying GitHub account or email asktugi@gmail.com to post for you. TUGI doesn't judge.
